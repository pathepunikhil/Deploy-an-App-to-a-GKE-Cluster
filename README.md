#Deploy an App to a GKE Cluster
This guide will walk you through the process of deploying an application to a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster using a GitHub repository. GKE provides a managed Kubernetes environment that makes it easy to deploy and scale containerized applications.

###Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project with billing enabled.
Google Cloud SDK installed on your local machine.
Docker installed on your local machine.
A GitHub repository containing your application's source code.
Steps
Follow these steps to deploy your app to a GKE cluster:

###Set up a GKE Cluster:

Create a new project in the Google Cloud Console or select an existing one.
Navigate to the Kubernetes Engine section.
Click on "Create Cluster" to create a new GKE cluster.
Configure the cluster settings according to your requirements and click "Create" to provision the cluster.
Prepare your GitHub Repository:

Make sure your app's source code is hosted on GitHub.
Ensure your repository has a valid Kubernetes manifest file (e.g., a YAML file) that describes how to deploy your app.
###Configure Google Cloud SDK:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Authenticate the Google Cloud SDK using your Google Cloud account by running the following command and following the instructions:
Copy code
gcloud auth login
###Clone the GitHub Repository:

In the terminal or command prompt, clone the GitHub repository containing your app's source code:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/pathepunikhil/project-1.git
###Build a Container Image:

###Navigate to your app's source code directory:
bash
Copy code
cd your-repo
###Build a container image using Docker:
arduino
Copy code
docker build -t gcr.io/your-project-id/your-image-name:tag .
###Push the Container Image to Container Registry:

###Configure Docker to authenticate to Container Registry:
Copy code
gcloud auth configure-docker
###Push the container image to Container Registry:
arduino
Copy code
docker push gcr.io/your-project-id/your-image-name:tag
Deploy the App to GKE:

Use kubectl to apply the Kubernetes manifest file from your GitHub repository to the GKE cluster:
bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f path/to/your/manifest-file.yaml
Congratulations! Your application will now be deployed to the GKE cluster based on the configuration provided in the manifest file.

Make sure to replace your-project-id, your-image-name, tag, and path/to/your/manifest-file.yaml with the appropriate values specific to your project and repository.

Conclusion
In this guide, you have learned how to deploy an application to a GKE cluster using a GitHub repository. GKE simplifies the process of managing containerized applications in a Kubernetes environment, allowing you to focus on developing and scaling your application with ease.
